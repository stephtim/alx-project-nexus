# PURPOSE - E-Commerce Backend
## This is a project which will illustrate the skills learned during the 8 months of learning in the ProDEv oftware Backend course.
The project will also showcase a running project with these skills displayed.
## Skills
THe Major skills to be diplayed are :
### Writing code in Python
### Constructing apps using Django
### Implementation of REST APIs and GraphQl
###  Use of containers in Docker and implementing CI/CD

## Backend Development Concepts
### The use of Database designs to clearly illustrate the schema of the application to be made will be utilised.
### Asynchronous programming and  caching strategies will be an integral part of the project.

## Challenges Faced
### It took a lot of research and reading to become familiar with concepts in the program, epecially on the programming part which is very challenging. 
Learning how to use some environments was also not easy, but the difficulties were overcome by resilience and determination.
### Implementation is also a challenge because debugging is difficult when experience in spotting out the cause of errors is limited.

## Best Practices
### Keeping in touch with peers has helped to keep focus on the learning. The learning curve has been very steep and not eay, but some peers have been very instrumental 
keeping me on course. Presentation of code and formatting of files is a practice I have learned is essential not forgetting documentation and clear file structures.
## Personal takeaways
### This course has opened a world of posibilities for me and it is only the beginning of learning and discovering. Backend programming has a lot to learn and a lot of reward and 
satisfaction in achievement.
